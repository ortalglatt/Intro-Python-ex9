==================
In this exercise, we built three classes - Car, Board, Game.
The game class is using functions from the Car and the Board classes, and by
using them, it runs the whole game.

* The Car class:
Attributes: name, length, location and orientation.
This class doesn't know the board and the game.
The class contains:
Functions that return an information about the car -
  name, car coordinates, possible moves due to the orientation, what cell need
  to be empty if the user wants to move it to some direction.
Functions that change the car attributes -
  moves the car by changing it's location.

* The Board class:
This class knows the board and the cars on the board, but doesn't know the
game.
The class contains:
Functions that return an information about the board -
  list of all the cells in the board, the target coordinates, a list of all the
  possible moves of the cars on the board, if a specific cell is content.
Functions that change the board -
  add new car to the board, move a car one step on the board to a specific
  direction.

* The Game class:
Attributes: board.
This class knows all the rules of the game, and it knows the cars and the
board.
The class contains:
Function that check if the user's input is valid, function that runs a single
turn and a function that runs the whole game.

* Out of the class, their is the function add_car, that set the beginning board
due to the information in the json file (that the user asked).
